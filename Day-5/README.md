## ðŸ“… Day 5 â€“ Animations + Responsive Chat Layout

In these two days, I upgraded my HTML tutorial into a **chat experience** that's both animated and mobile-friendly!

### ðŸ’¡ What I added:
- âœ… Chat-style messages with left/right alignment using **Flexbox**
- âœ… Smooth fade-in animations using `@keyframes`
- âœ… `animation-delay` to simulate real chat timing
- âœ… Responsive layout with `@media` queries for phones
